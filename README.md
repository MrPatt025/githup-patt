# 👋 Hi, I'm Frenz Fries 🍟⚡  
**Resilient Tech Explorer | AI & Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Embedded Systems Alchemist**

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a **Computer Engineer** who thrives at the intersection of **AI, Cybersecurity, Robotics, and Embedded Systems**. My code is fueled by curiosity, crispy ideas (like fries!), and the belief that **failure is a debugger for success**.  

---

## 🔑 Core Philosophy  
> *"Failure isn’t the opposite of success — it’s the compiler that optimizes your next breakthrough."*  

I treat every problem as a **puzzle waiting for reverse-engineering**, whether I’m hardening IoT devices or teaching robots to think creatively.

# My Coding Mantra  
while True:  
    try:  
        experiment()  
    except Failure:  
        print("Debugging life, one fry at a time 🍟")
